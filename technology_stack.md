- **Version Control**: Git

## Technology Justification

### Why Node.js for Microservices?
1. **JavaScript Across Stack**: Enables full-stack JavaScript development, reducing context switching
2. **Non-blocking I/O**: Excellent for handling many concurrent connections
3. **Rich Ecosystem**: Vast library of packages for various functionalities
4. **Lightweight**: Perfect for microservices that need to be independently deployable
5. **JSON Native**: Natural fit for REST APIs and document databases

### Why MongoDB?
1. **Schema Flexibility**: Ideal for rapid prototyping and evolving data models
2. **Document Model**: Natural fit for educational content and user profiles
3. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capabilities for future growth
4. **Performance**: Good read/write performance for our use cases
5. **Geospatial Support**: Useful for potential location-based features

### Why React?
1. **Component Architecture**: Promotes reusable UI components
2. **Virtual DOM**: Efficient rendering and updates
3. **Ecosystem**: Rich library of components and tools
4. **Developer Experience**: Excellent developer tools and debugging
5. **Mobile Options**: Potential for React Native expansion in the future

## Innovative Technical Approaches

1. **GraphQL Integration**
   - Will implement GraphQL alongside REST for complex data queries
   - Reduces over-fetching and under-fetching of data
   - Provides flexible API for frontend development

2. **Serverless Functions**
   - Will use serverless functions for specific microservices
   - Reduces operational overhead
   - Provides automatic scaling for variable workloads

3. **AI Integration**
   - TensorFlow.js for client-side machine learning capabilities
   - Natural language processing for content analysis
   - Recommendation algorithms for personalized learning

4. **WebRTC**
   - Peer-to-peer communication for virtual classroom
   - Real-time audio/video capabilities
   - Screen sharing for collaborative learning

5. **WebAssembly**
   - Performance-critical components compiled to WebAssembly
   - Enables complex calculations and simulations in the browser
   - Supports interactive learning experiences

## Technology Constraints and Considerations

1. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Support for modern browsers (last 2 versions)
   - Progressive enhancement for older browsers
   - Accessibility considerations across platforms

2. **Performance Targets**
   - Initial page load under 2 seconds
   - Time to interactive under 3.5 seconds
   - Smooth 60fps animations and transitions

3. **Security Considerations**
   - OWASP security best practices implementation
   - Regular dependency auditing
   - Content Security Policy implementation

4. **Offline Capabilities**
   - Critical functionality available offline
   - Background synchronization when connection is restored
   - Clear user feedback about offline status

## Next Steps

With the technology stack defined, we will proceed to:
1. Design the database schema
2. Set up the project structure and development environment
3. Implement core authentication functionality
4. Develop service communication patterns
5. Create initial UI components
